    <h3>Shipping Your Puppy</h3>
    <p>If you are unable to come meet us in person and drive your new puppy home, we offer shipping, via most major Airlines.  
      <br><br>
      How it works: 
      <br><br>
      1. We need your full name, phone number, and address, like it is on your license, as well as your mailing address if its different.  
      (We like to have it as it is on your license because it makes it smoother when you get to the airport, and we need your mailing address to send you the puppy's 
      paperwork, as we don't send it on the plane with him or her). <br><br>  
      2. After we have this info, I will work on getting you the flight. This sometimes takes a few days, 
      as it depends some on the weather,  usually I get your flight details to you the week of shipping.  As soon as I get the shipping information I send it on to you, 
      this includes the Airway Bill number, flight numbers, and flight times, as well as an address and directions to the area you will need to go to pick up the puppy. 
      This is usually the cargo facility, but sometimes baggage depending on the size of your airport, and the time the flight arrives. <br><br> 
      3. I will send you a few links to track the puppy's progress, so you know for sure that the flight is not delayed etc. 
      Occasionally weather gets in the way and flights are delayed, if that happens you are welcome to give me a call, and I will track it for you!!  
      When the time arrives to go to the airport, it would be a good idea to take along a collar, leash, and a towel. 
      (we put a potty pad and newspapers in the kennel for the trip, but you may want to get rid of that and replace with a blanket or towel) 
      You will need your picture ID, and its a good idea to take along the airway bill number as well, as they use that to track if something were to go wrong.  
      Also please remember to shoot me a quick email or text, so that I know for sure that you have your new puppy and that he or she has made the trip safely!! ;) </p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Do you vaccinate your puppies?
        <br><br>
        - Yes, our puppies get all the vaccinations they need up until the time they leave our premises. 
        <br><br>   
        Do the puppies come with full or limited AKC registration?
        <br><br>
        - Yes, our puppies are AKC registered, unless otherwise noted. We offer limited registration. We also provide the AKC Basic Puppy Registration Package to our buyers at no additional cost. 
        <br>   <br>
        When/How do I place a deposit?
        <br><br>
        - If you have caught us at a time where we do not have any puppies available and you wish to get on the waiting list, we require $100 waitlist fee.  This fee comes out of total amount charged for the puppy and is to ensure we only add serious buyers to the waitlist.  In the past, prior to adding the waitlist fee, we had many people on the waiting list who would ghost us once the puppies were born.  The waiting list fee helps prevent this issue and ensure everyone on the list is serious.
        <br><br>
        - As soon as you have settled on a puppy or if on the waiting list your puppy is born, you will then pay the deposit to hold your puppy. (You are welcome to call or email at any time throughout the decision process!!)  Sometimes there are several people looking at the same puppy, but whoever gets the deposit down first gets the puppy. We require a $550.00 deposit, which comes out of the total cost of the puppy.  When you are ready to make the payment, give me a call, or send an email to confirm that the puppy you are looking at is for sure available. Then I can send you an invoice, you can call with your credit card info, or you are always welcome to set up an appointment to meet the pup in person and place your deposit then!! 
        <br><br>
        If I place a deposit or pay a waiting list fee, can it be refunded?
        <br><br>
        - No, we don't refund deposits because of the time it takes to relist the puppies that we thought were sold, as well as the fact that if selling age is past it is harder to resell, and sometimes have to reduce prices.  However, if the puppy would get sick while still with us or have a genetic defect we would notify you and give you the option of refunding the deposit, or transferring it to a different puppy. Waiting list fees are non-refundable.
        <br><br>
        At what age can I pickup my puppy?
        <br><br>
        - Our puppies can't leave us until they are 8 weeks old. That is a USDA rule, so we can't let the puppy go anytime before that, not even a day or so.  
        <br><br>
        What food do you feed, and where can I find it?
        <br><br>
        - We feed our puppies Kirkland Signature Puppy Food from Costco. We also have our puppies 
        started on NuVet Plus supplements, because they support the puppy's immune system,
        which is important especially during transition to their new home. NuVet also is great
        for overall health of the dog, great for their joints, and has even been proven to reduce 
        cancer!! Be sure to check it out, and read the testimonials at www.nuvet.com/54865
        <br><br>
        When does final payment take place?
        <br><br>
        - If you are coming here to pick up your puppy, or if we are meeting, you are welcome to bring the cash along, or we can take credit card / venmo / zelle payments at the time of pickup.  
        If we are shipping the puppy to you we usually wait until after the flight details are confirmed to have you pay, just so that you are more comfortable with it. 
        (It must be paid in full a day or two before the puppy flies out) If you would rather get the payment out of the way sooner than that that is totally fine with me. 
        <br><br>   
        Do you have a guarantee or contract?
        <br><br>
