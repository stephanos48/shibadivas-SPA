      <h4>
        It works as follows:<br><br>
        1. Send an email to <b>shibadivaspuppies@gmail.com</b> requesting a spot on the waiting list.<br>
            - Please include all relevant contact info in your email.<br>
            - If you have any preferences (boy or girl, sesame or red, etc), please specify in the email<br><br>
        2. We will review your email and send you an email response with various options on how to pay the $100 waiting list fee**<br><br> 
        3. Once the waitlist payment is received, we will update the waiting list below with your info within 24 hrs.<br><br>
        4. We will periodically email updates (i.e. when shiba moms go into heat, puppies are born, etc) to future fur-parents on the waiting list<br><br>
        5. Once your waiting list number has come up, we will contact you with the good news and at that time you will be able to place a deposit down on your fur-baby.<br>
            - Once the deposit is made, the puppy is held just for you until he/she is ready to make the journey to your location.<br>
            - Per our terms, deposits and waiting list fees are non-refundable.
      </h4><br><br>
      <h4>**We charge the waiting list fee to make sure everyone on the waiting list is a serious buyer.  In the past, when we did not charge this fee, we would add
      people to the waiting list, they would take up a spot for a serious buyer and then they would ghost us when the puppies were born.  
      This fee helps to prevent this and ensure everyone on the list is serious.  The waiting list fee comes out of the total 
      amount we charge for the puppy.  In addition, dates for birth of puppies are just estimates and can change.  Nature does things in 
      her own time and we cannot control when and how many puppies are born.</h4>
