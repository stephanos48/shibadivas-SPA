                <p>Good Wednesday from Shiba Divas!  Our family went on a long bike ride today.  We wanted PF Chang today and my Dad decided he would make 
                us work for it.  So long story short, we rode bikes for like 15 miles today.  Too long and too hot!  But we did get to see
                some awesome trails and of course eat PF Chang at the halfway point.  We love the chicken lettuce wraps there.  
                The good news is that in spite of being a bit exhausted, we did have some time to upload a few puppy pics and a new YouTube Video.  
                <br><br>
                In other news, Shahira K. set up her visit to see Sasuke tomorrow.  We are so excited to see her again and meet her mom.

                <p>Happy Tuesday from Shiba Divas!  Today was an exciting day.  Kakashi, Itachi, Jaraiya and Naruto found their forever homes today. 
                We got to meet Mrs. Leeanne and her family in person when they were choosing Itachi.  It turns out her husband is a big 
                Naruto fan like my sister.  
                <br><br>
                Also, we had a bit of a caper in the house today.  Here is a picture of Khalessi (our resident escape-artist) enjoying her plunder.  She somehow got a hold of my dad's Ritz stash and went
                to her favortie spot on the couch to enjoy.  My mom caught her when she got home.  All of our Shiba's love Ritz.  I am not sure why, but they do!  If they even hear the 
                rustle of the bag now, they go crazy.

                <p>Good morning everyone from Shiba Divas!  We are so excited to announce the kick off of our blog today.  
                We often get questions about our fur-babies and we thought this would be a good way to keep everyone up-to-date and
                also share some of the hilarious antics of our little shiba pack.  We get to see them every day, and it seems selfish
                to keep them all to ourselves.  
                <br>Also, we thought this would be a great way to keep our waiting list fur-baby parents updated while
                they are waiting for their fur-baby.  
                <br>Our post today is going to focus on Khalessi's new litter of puppies. They were born on 6/4/2021 and just so adorable!  
                We are currently working our way down the waiting list to finalize their forever homes.  Please click the link for the 
                corresponding youtube video for this blog post.
                <br>FYI - Our cousins are visiting from out of town, so you may see them in some of the videos we post over the 
                next few weeks.
